## Objective
- Write a Qualean class that is inspired by Boolean+Quantum concepts. We can assign it only 3 possible real states. True, False, and Maybe (1, 0, -1) but it internally picks an imaginary state. The moment you assign it a real number, it immediately finds an imaginary number random.uniform(-1, 1) and multiplies with it and stores that number internally after using Bankers rounding to 10th decimal place.  
 
- It implements these functions (with exactly the same names) 
&nbsp;
``` html 
    __and__,  __or__, __repr__, __str__, __add__, __eq__, __float__,
    __ge__, __gt__, __invertsign__, __le__, __lt__, __mul__, __sqrt__, 
    __bool__

```
&nbsp;
- Write a test file, that tests all of the functions mentioned above + the other basic ones 
- Test file must contain at least 25 tests
